This site is the website version of a resume, complete with working samples and a full code/development history of how it came to be. It's built on Astro.js using Node and currently live at [https://hirethis.one](https://hirethis.one/?utm_source=github&utm_content=readme). 


## 🗂️ A Portfolio & Training Resource

Every job needs work samples. My work samples come in the form of this website. It contains a full guide on how to create a site just like it, aimed at a beginner audience. This guide is in-progress as of 10/10/2025 and contains 7 sections so far with more to come. 

Topics covered include:

- ⭐ Astro JS
- ☁️ Cloudflare
- 🖥️ Terminal Interfaces
- 🌐 Domain Name System & Registrars
- ✒️ Markdown Files
- 📝 Web Development

Users will be able to download a template file, edit its contents, build the site, and deploy to cloudflare by completion of the guide series, reguardless of their prior development experience.


## 🔧 Requirements

To build this portfolio site, you will need:

    Node.js 18+ (or 20+ recommended)
    npm (or pnpm/yarn)


To view the site locally, run:

```

```

Consult the guides on the [live site](https://hirethis.one/guides/?utm_source=github&utm_content=requirementslink) for further guidance in building and customizing this and other sites like it.


## 🗓️ Updates

The goal is to make 1-2 updates to the site's content per week, but this isn't guaranteed.

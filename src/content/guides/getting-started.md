Anyone can build a website. If you can operate a computer, you too can make a website. There are likely thousands of guides and tutorials across the internet explaining the basic principals of websites, development, and web design. In these guides, we're going to keep to a narrow focus and a limited set of tools to get your website online quickly and easily.

## Project Overview

Over the course of these guides, we will download a website template, customize it, and upload it to a webhost. This isn't the complete guide to web development, just a quick step into building a blogging/portfolio style website using Astro. You'll be using the same tools as every other professional web developer and you'll be able to go far beyond these guides with those tools. Want to make a site of your own with another template? Want to make a site from scratch with your own code? These tools will get you there.

This guide is your stepping stone into development. For many developers, once they've had some help making the first site, their own curiosity carries them to the next step, and the next, and the next. Our abilities as creators, engineers, and developers are built on a thousand small steps. This is a small step into development.

The links below will take you through the guides in their proper order. Some guides may be released on the site out of order or may be entirely optional components like using [Github](https://github.com).

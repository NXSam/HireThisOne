Over the past ten years, I've worked in dozens of industries: web design, eCommerce, construction, aerospace, automotive, home improvement, furniture, electronics, HVAC, graphic design, and so much more. It's fair to say, I've come a long way, watching innovations and revolutions sweep the industry. Procedural modeling, GPU rendering, realtime rendering, and so much more has become common, with wilder technologies on the horizon. The industry has never been more capable or accessible.

I'm not going to write about every clip in my reel, but some projects certainly stand out.

## Some Highlights From the Reel

#### [Chang'e Animation](/portfolio/change-animation)

The first few shots of my reel showcase some of the Chinese Chang'e family of rovers, probes, orbiters, and landers. My client needed educational contact for the Chinese market to show off their display technology for investors. These animations looked amazing with their system, having a real sense of depth to the image, it was unlike anything I'd ever experienced on a display.

I was charged with figuring out how to create the videos in the proper format, writing a script, and getting everything together for the client in under a month. It was constant work, researching the probes, finding all the reference images I could, and delivering on an ambitious, tight-deadline script.

#### The Glasses Project

I consider myself a workhorse, able to just grind through projects of any scale, with great speed. My client was releasing an Augmented Reality App to try on their glasses frames. They had a catalog of hundreds of glasses. It was my job to model them as fast as possible.

As with many projects, it also fell to me to solve a problem: how.

The app itself was coded for Apple devices and the workflow was a bit unusual. Everything had to be baked and exported as a GLTF file, then converted to USDZ. Transparency data had to be baked into the model, by removing the back of the arms, we saved a small bit of modeling time that added up.

In about six weeks I modeled maybe 300 pairs of glasses? It was a lot. The boxes cluttered my office. Every pair was measured with calipers, pictures were taken as reference to be used in Blender. Lots of modeling happened morning, noon, and night.

#### Modeling Doors by the Dozen

I didn't get fast over night. I worked in bulk on many projects before I touched those glasses. My work for SS Industries, based not far from my office in Pennsylvania, was to model their doors. I was given blueprint drawings, pantone colors, and sometimes reference images - to produce hundreds of doors.

There was one easy way to speed the process up: templates.

Each door I modeled as another spring board in the repository. I might be called to model a wood paneled door with a window. Find the wood paneled door, add a window, and the job's done. My first doors would take 2 hours to model, making the tracks, handles, and components. With my library now, they're a 20 minute job.

#### Adventure Wagon

Adventure Wagon needed a 3D configurator for their products. They wanted to show what your van could look like with their products and let you create your custom build, ready to go right in the cart on their web store. Loading 3D models in browsers can have performance issues, it's not always realistic. Instead of doing that, we'd just front-load all the work on the artist - me.

I received CAD files for some products, references and measurements for others. Everything was processed, modeled, built, and setup. In the end, it becomes thousands of permutations to generate every possible layout. Even just generating each asset in every permutation is thousands of images.

Why work hard when you can code? I wrote a script that would generate each asset in all of its material combinations, used cryptomattes to isolate each item, and let the computer do the hard work over night. Now every piece is an individual image in the builder and Adventure Wagon can show off their van products with ease.

#### The Tiny Home

My client designs tiny home kits, they were looking to standardize the look of their manuals, update their looks, and create animations to go along with. I modeled the complete assembly of the cabin and generated dozens of still shots for the manual. The overall animation was then made from the same files to showcase how to build the whole cabin live.

The hard part was probably making the manual. I was given example material, distilled the important elements, and created a style-compatible manual that matched both where my client was going and where they'd been. It fit their look and brand well, as well as providing a more appealing guide for their customers.

#### [Solar Speed Rack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yr5sr7OpqjM)

Hands down this is one of my favorite projects. SSR made roof-mounting hardware for solar panels and had ambitions of expanding their business. At the time there was a pretty big weakness in the industry's marketing: everyone used their CAD engineers to make their marketing.

Tools like AutoCAD and Solidworks have animation capabilities, in the same was as a hammer can beat a screw into wood: it works, but it's not optimal.

I came in to provide PBR materials, model products, animate the panels, and I had a contact at SSR who cared about animation. It's the first time, perhaps the only time I've had a client specifically want the 12 Principals of Animation to play a pivotal role in the animation. Most clients just want pieces to move and done. Not them. Every piece of the animation had to feel like it had weight and movement. It made everything look so much better.

I'll admit, in hindsight: I wish I'd put in the time to make the roof less ugly. It was sacrificed to the almighty budget constraints.

>It was a pleasure to work with Sam. He is a true professional and has extensive knowledge on many different platforms. Sam has great communication skills and often provides excellent suggestions for improvements. He adheres to deadlines, understands instructions clearly and always provides top notch results. We highly recommend Sam for any graphical, video, animation or production need. Thanks for the great work Sam!

#### [Azden Pro-XR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDTQzd1JHIE)

Azden produced a radio mic that was designed to bypass interference. The idea isn't completely straightforward to explain, especially for people who don't know radio technology. I was given a rough sketch of the idea and then turned loose to upgrade it into something that looked awesome.

The most important part of this project was Procedural Animation. Using Expression Scripts in After Effects, I created a controller and dynamically created the animation. This allowed me to rapidly customize the animation to my clients' feedback, without having to redo significant, tedious manual work. Update one element and they all update. Move one control and everything moves. It was predictable, reliable, and got the project done in less than two weeks.

>Sam did a great job for us on a uniquely challenging project. Was available when we needed him and completed the work on the expected timeline. Highly recommend.

#### The Parkinson's Cane

One of my first product design projects, I was tasked with making a cane concept for Parkinsons' patients. Essentially, a laser-line can help these patients make more precise movements, helping them overcome their motor control issues. My client's original idea was a cane with a fiber optic/bendable laser head that would stick out from the cane to be aimed at will.

The problem in the base concept was it called attention to itself. My client wanted the cane to look good without drawing attention to the laser or any other details of it.

I ran with the idea and added a ton of features in the design process:
- The cane would be modular, allowing for height, handle, and color customizations.
- Potted PCBs to add shock resistance, integrated electronics could pair with a phone to detect falls and call 911 automatically.
- Spring loaded contacts between the handles and base would add buttons to the handles to turn on the laser.
- Embed the laser in a rotory piece in the lower grip, hiding it from sight while allowing aim adustment.

The design was a hit with the client. I got a very nice review for the work:

>Working with Sam has been an absolute pleasure - he's one of the smartest guys I've worked with. He cared very deeply about the project and made some extremely valuable suggestions that we incorporated as well. All the best to Sam! Will love to work with him in the future.

#### Aquaponic

My client wanted a simple animation showing water flowing through their filter. I accidentally over delivered to the point that they expanded the whole idea for the video. My briefing was to show their filter in a parking lot, everything should look nice, we should see it fill up and water come out to go in the storm water system.

I made a little strip mall, spent a lot of time getting the look dialed in, and used a combination of Eevee and Cycles to deliver both excellent looking water and fast animation in two weeks. Everything hit just right for the rainy, dark-weather atmosphere my client wanted and then they decided to get some voice over in, some extra editing done, and converted it from a little explainer piece to a full on ad for their technology.

>He was very responsive and made this project go smoothly through excellent communication via messaging. When appropriate, he used telephone conversations to ensure all milestones and details were met completely understood. His attention to detail was spot on and when given creative latitudes, he over-delivered. Great work!!

# Thanks For Reading!

If you read all of that, thanks for reading about my work. I wrote more than I planned, and didn't write everything I thought of, but I hope it provides some good background on the work I've done over the years.

If you're still curious, have a look at where I started.

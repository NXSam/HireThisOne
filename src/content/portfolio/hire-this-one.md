My whole career has been spread between industries. I'm a developer, no I'm an artist, no I'm a video editor, technical artist, graphic designer, tech support, analyst, web developer, sys-adminâ€”NO! I'm--

As a freelancer, I've worn every hat, done a dozen jobs, and always taught myself how to do whatever came next. It's great that I've gotten to do a million things, but it's hard to put those skills into a resume and even harder to sell them to a recruiter. My job history is a hundred contracts long and spans almost as many industries and roles. Personally, I don't think there's many jobs I couldn't do. The problem however, is proving that to the people writing the checks.

I've set out to become a Technical Writer and leave freelancing.

I just don't - didn't - have the proof of my abilities. I've needed something to get my foot in the door with any potential employer. I can show up with videos, but that doesn't mean I can write and document anything. I can point to my coding experiences, but they don't stand out on the resume. I could spend another year tracking down freelance writing jobs, but that's more overhead and freelancing.

Instead, I'll just make the proof myself.

This website is a demonstration of my ability to work with new and unfamiliar technology, to create documentation about that technology, and showcase my existing work in pursuit of steady work in an industry that's drawn my interest.

Maybe the name, HireThis.One will get a laugh from the right recruiter or act as the right directive for an AI screening system to pick me out of the pool of applicants.

Information about creating this site will be [posted in Guides](/guides) for all to read about replicating this site, from ideation to final posting to Cloudflare. I'll endeavor to write in multiple styles to demonstrate both specific step by step guides and more casual overviews of concepts at large.

The site's code [will be posted on Github](https://github.com/SWC4/HireThisOne) for all to read and examine. I'm not the world's greatest web developer, so it's definitely flawed, but it works. It's my first time using Astro and I'd say it's gone pretty well so far!

Additional details will be [posted to the blog](/blog).

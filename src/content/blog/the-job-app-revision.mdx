I saw a job last week that I was very eager to apply to. There is some belief that you have to apply to a job on the same day it's posted to have any chance at getting seen. It's not the greatest constraint, but it's got a fair chance at having a grain of truth to it. Employers probably use one of two ways to review resumes. Either in the order received or using an ATS system that scores them, they look at the highest scores first.

It was Friday afternoon after a long workday when I saw the job posting. I hadn't had a break all day, but I saw a job that I wanted. To be fair, I apply to a lot of jobs I would love to have. This job just caught my eye after a day of writing content and wrestling spreadsheets. It would've been better to go have my dinner and then return to fill out the application, but there was that notiong to get the first entry in.

There were four questions and I think all four are really good questions. They're so good that I want to answer them again, minus the company's name. If their recruiter sees this, then they know who they are. For everyone else: it's a bit more insight about myself and my thought processes.

<Accordion defaultValue="item-1" style="margin:auto;padding:1.5rem;">
  <AccordionItem value="item-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>What led you to apply for this position?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>



My application can be broken down into two motivating factors:
- Why am I looking at all?
- Why this job in particular?

I've spent the past decade freelancing in technical and creative fields. I've written reports, analysis documents, research, proposals, plans of action, scripts for most of my clients. Just as many clients have had me coding websites, managing their IT infrastructure, and creating elements of their marketing and training through animation and graphic design. I like the work, but not the way that I get it.

My plan always had been to freelance for a while and then move to a steady W2 position once I had a portfolio of work and a significant amount of experience. Recently the freelance market has been like a house of cards in a hurricane. The small business economy that formed the core of my client base hasn't been in the best of shape.

I could spend 100 hours pursuing freelance clients or I could package myself up for something longterm and admittedly less stressful than freelancing. When you freelance, you're always looking for the next job, worrying over contract language, and working longer hours. If a client calls me at 10 PM with a problem, I'm probably going to be trying to fix that problem at 10 PM.

A steady position, where I can have a strong expectation of what I'm doing, a reliable paycheck, PTO, sickdays, and a few thousand other upsides is a strong motivating factor. I think in this market, it might even be faster and easier to land a W2 position than more contract work.

**Why this job?**

I believe the position is as perfect a fit as I've seen in any job I've applied to. Every applicant of course has to tell you "I'm perfect for the job." There are some more unique traits in your job post I think are a bit more on the nose for me in particular.

- A Deep Love for Technology
I'm self-taught. I don't learn things because it's forced on me or because it's necessary. I learn about technology because I want to know more. I've worked with Unity, Unreal, C#, C++, Three.JS, p5.js, pythonn, java, javascript, php, SQL, and so much more. I have hands on experience all over the map. Linux, Windows, Mac OS, dozens of libraries and tools. Some of this will show through in a later question's answer. I believe I'm more than technically proficient and my passion to learn and do more is an absolutely crucial asset in jobs like this. Hand me the tech manual for RHEL or something and I'll read it cover to cover like a novel. I've done that before.

- Someone with high self initiative.
I've had the initiative to found and operate a business, juggle a dozen projects, continue my own training and education, pursue new clients, and create better ways of working almost continuously for a decade. I have expanded my role and responsibilities with many of my clients to solve problems when I saw them.

- High self-standards
In my freelancing, I've had clients want me to make a worse product. They wanted the work done cheaper and wouldn't have me investing my time in an element that would make things better. It's one of the worst parts of the job. I turn down work if the client just wants slop. If a client has a genuine budget, I'll do some work for free because I will not turn out a worse product. I did that for an animation I just finished up. There were parts the client didn't care about, but I did. I fixed the problems and didn't bill them. Bad for business, sure, but I want my work to be good.

I looked at my answers from my application and came back here to redo them because the miniature essays I'd written did not meet my standards. I knew I could do better.

- Team Player
I've worked for a hundred teams, give or take. The developer says he has a problem with an API and I help him figure it out. An artist can't get an asset done in time, I'll make the asset or rought it out, whatever we need. A videographer on a team once messed up their exposure on a shoot, so I color corrected all of the footage to compensate before they did their edit. The team has a problem and I want to fix it.

- Passion for Improvement
There are clients I've had discussions with about how we can do better. We would go back and forth. I'd make a point about why doing X created obstacles to the job and would deter users. They respond with Y reason about it. We go back and forth. The client will ultimately decide, but if I see a way to make something better, clearer, or easier, I'm going to at least bring it up. If I can make the change, I will.

I have an immense range of skills and experiences that play a significant role in development and communications. My track record is a team player who's core focus has been to support the team wherever possible.

You're looking for a tech-savvy, skilled technical writer who is motivated to do a better job, supports the team, and delivers excellent results.

    <AccordionTrigger>What are you looking for in your next position?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>

I love to do the work that I do. I love writing, coding, analyzing, creating, fixing, researching, and experimenting with things. If I were left in a room with the guts of a computer and a stack of linux installers, I'd spend the day trying each platform on the machine and probably miss lunch because I wanted to figure out how to make one simple change on an Atomic Desktop (and have to do the whole rpm-ostree thing to 'commit' that change).

My next workplace is going to be filled with more productivity and less overhead. As a freelancer, I've spent I think 60% of my time on business-admin work, negotiating with clients, and handling stuff I've never wanted to do. I want to get up every morning and be greeted with new technical things to wrap my head around. I want to be part of a team of experts who loves this stuff too.

I want to have more time with the techy-stuff I love.

That doesn't mean 0 of the boring stuff. I would equally love the paperwork side of a job like this. Interviewing developers to ask what their pain points are and writing proposals for how we can make the platform better are just as techy as the work itself. Collaborating with the team on what pains we all face and finding ways to streamline processes or just make it a little better. It's not the same as business-overhead, trying to stand out on a cover letter while explaining to a client "go with me!" is draining. Explaining to management "if we add this UI element, we can drastically clarify this segment of the API, but I need the web dev team to make this bit here for us. You can see in our bit of testing with this mock up that our respondents had a clearer understanding" is an enjoyable task.

    <AccordionTrigger>How have you demonstrated our mindset in your previous roles?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>

      In my original answer, I based my response off the job description and I think that was a bit of a mistake. With my head not deep and bleary from documents, I kind of think this is a culture-fit question. And I want to base my response on your company values.

- Open to Feedback<br></br><br></br>I know I am not the best at anything. There will always be a better writer, coder, or animator out there. Feedback is the way we improve. There is a measure of give and take. If we change for any and all feedback, we lose ourselves. I like to know why something needs to be different and I want to factor that in to what I'm doing. If you tell me something is hard to follow, I want to know what I missed so I can smooth it out. If a graphic would have an issue for people with colorblindness, I need to fix that immediately. There can be some fun talk around feedback to, because we want to solve the same problem.<br></br><br></br>With most of my clients, we do disagree somewhere. I'll point out that a particular shot composition is an issue or that we need to make something longer. The client will say a sequence doesn't feel right. Sometimes we can ID the problem and fix it right away. Sometimes I have to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks.<br></br><br></br>The end goal is to make something as good as it can be. It's crucial to focus on why something doesn't work and make a change there.

- Diverse Perspectives<br></br><br></br>This goes hand in hand with processing feedback and making something that works. What's clear as day to one person isn't to someone else. Something offensive to one person isn't offensive to another. We have to learn from the people around us.<br></br><br></br>On a "does this thing work?" level, that's testing and questioning whether something is as understandable to developers as it is to the engineers or new users. On a person to person level, it's learning about the different ways people live. I'm actually somewhat excited for that aspect of the job, working with European coworkers. I do have friends in France, England, Germany, Spain, and Poland, but working with and learning more from people over there is going to be fun.

- People-Focused<br></br><br></br>I think to focus on people, we get back to the old addage 'treat people how you want to be treated.' We want to have an easy and good experience for ourselves. That can mean calling your ISP and getting a clear answer about when the network's coming back and it can be answering a frustrated dev's email about why something didn't work. People have bad days too and we might get a little flack from a coworker or a customer. Everyone has those days where their umbrella ripped, their donut was soggy, and the car got a flat in a downpour. Have patience, try to make their day better, and if you can get them to laugh (to feel a little better), do it.<br></br><br></br>I've not always been good at focusing on people. I made a lot of mistakes in my teens, but those years are in part for us to be stupid. I've learned to be better at helping people in their bad days and helping things keep moving forward.

- Trust and Excellence<br></br><br></br>I think maybe my best embodiment of this is from the teams I've worekd with. I've always gotten good reviews for integrating with other teams. Always gone out of my way to help others. In High School, I stayed after school to help other students, in college I went out of my way to help student productions without any real benefit to myself - even once just seeing someone struggle to push an equipment cart a long, steep hill, so I did it for them.<br></br><br></br>Excellence is I think a willingness to go out of your way for others. And also a good bit of patience when someone's stuck on something. I've had to talk many clients through simple matters, playing their tech support, and patiently getting them from A to B. I have a lot of experience there.

- Exploring and Experimentation<br></br><br></br>This is the one of your values I have been most excited to answer. I love to experiment and do new things and I do it fearlessly. I wanted a better system for running DnD Games, so I got into docker. I wanted to get away from the windows 10 EOL security issues, so I started installing Linux on old machines. I wanted to stand out better to employers, so I built a site with a static generator I'd never touched before. It needed to be easy and cheap to host so I learned cloudflare.<br></br><br></br>My whole career is experimentation. I had rendering projects that would've taken years if done by hand - I scripted automations. I had tedious work, and automated it. I wanted to know if I was getting any traction on my site - I added analytics and started studying the data. You saw that in my site link on the application too.<br></br><br></br>We learn best by doing things, trying things. Something will undoudtedly go wrong, but we'll learn from it. I'm never going to trust BTRFS just works on a new linux install. I'm also maybe never going to trust NVidia Drivers again in Linux, but I'm not the only person who's learned that lesson the hard way. Things go wrong. We learn. And we learn better ways to do things so our future experiments don't blow up in our faces.<br></br><br></br>I've put my money where my mouth is too, I adopt a lot of new technologies early. Most frequently with new indie software, addons and tools that I think will make a big splash or be incredibly useful some day. That doesn't always pay off either, but I always learn from it.

- Doing Things Right & With Quality<br></br><br></br>We should always strive to do the best that we can. People can slack off when they think something doesn't matter, but we shouldn't. You can see this in infrastructure. You'll find places where some engineer took the time to precisely bend miles of conduit, color code all of it, and create a work of art, because it's easier to read, quality, and the right way to do it. No one's ever going to see it except the guy who has to fix a bad wire, but it'll make that guy's life easier too. <br></br><br></br>I gave an example of this on a prior question. My client with the animation that I went back and improved for no cost. It's not the first time I've done that. I've always done that. It's usually subtle where I do it, but it has a tangible impact. One of my favorite instances of doing something right comes from an animation. I use those a lot in my examples here, I think they stand out more when you do something wrong. Code that compiles is 'good' code until it breaks. A bad animation is bad from the start.<br></br><br></br>My client sold water filters for run off collection. They wanted a 30 second demo of how their system worked. I wrote a script, they approved. It was over 30 seconds, and it was a fixed price contract, so going the extra mile didn't make me any richer. I delivered far enough above their expectations that their marketing team took the footage to make a whole, bigger video from with narration and all. I could've done the minimum and my client would've been happy. I didn't even necessarily intend to over deliver, but I did.

<hr></hr>

I'm a doer who's surrounded by a diverse crowd, who does his best to do things the right way, explores, tries to help people at every turn, and I take criticism pretty well. I don't have an ego about my work, I just want things to be their best.

    <AccordionTrigger>What side project, hobby or life experience are you most passionate about? Share (1) a challenge you faced and how you solved it, and (2) one thing you'd do differently if you started today. Add references and links, if you have them.</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
    This is the question I most wanted to revise. It's the last question I answered and I rambled. I like the rambling answer a lot, but it wasn't structured well.

My biggest passion project right now is Dungeons and Dragons. I wrote about it [recently](/portfolio/ttrpg). I've been running campaigns since 2022, so this is my third year running it. I have a diverse group of players from around the world who've played in three of my campaigns. I'm now down to two that I run, at least one game every week. I strive to deliver that game without fail. My consistency and reliability has kept my players coming back. They know I will do everything possible to deliver and that we've had a lot of fun.

My challenge in achieving this goal was a reliable system to do it. The logistics and infrastructure of running the game digitally need to be conquered and optimized.

I need:
- a system of notes that is easy to keep up with, plan, track, and document everything
- a web platform for the game that is easy, reliable, and easy to add content
- a way to add content rapidly

Each of these problems needs to be conquered and solved so the game can run well. They were all problems I did not have solved in my first year of doing the game. Not even in the second. I needed a process and workflow that could move me from ideation to completion every week, with a minimum of headache and wasted time. As we'll cover, there were obstacles that created friction when I first tried all of this without a good workflow.

Note Taking:

My original approach to notes was to use Notion. I threw up material in a haphazard attempt at organization. Some people had made templates and integrations for various pieces of it all, but it wasn't ideal. The tool wasn't designed for this job. It felt limiting. 

My second attempt was to use Obsidian and that was very successful. The system was simpler. Markdown and links were at the core of it. I could link to specific pieces of notes. There were addons that would load in stat blocks and dice rollers. I could load the notes into a VTT if I wanted. Backup and sync across platforms. It was simple, but I was able to build tangled webs of intrigue.

Then came the template. My own first attempts had a template system that took little form responses. It worked. It wasn't as cool as what I found. Bag of Tips created an Obsidian system that dynamically linked and structured everything, it had templates for items, places, events, and more. Everything was an easy form to fill out and customize. There were ways to use frontmatter and tie everything together. I've since built on and modified that to fit my needs. I'll need to make updates for Obsidian Bases in the future.

I wanted to have an archive too, of every session. Not just notes. It takes an hour to write a detailed session summary. Next best option? Transcripts. A bot called Craig records all my players individually and then Whisper transcribes that. I use Apple's AI integration to summarize the transcripts. Both of those go in the notes and I have a comprehensive document of what I planned and what happened.

A session can be planned day-of without issue.

A Platform:

The hosting costs are what kill you for running games. You have to subscribe to roll 20 or some other platform or pay a host to run your FoundryVTT server. I tried having Foundry hosted, but the platforms I used were always buggy. The server would suspend after a set period of inactivity, it saves the host money. My players needed me to wake the server, it would take time, there were issues and friction. If we ran a game session during busy hours, the service lagged and our game suffered. Players would disconnect and simple functions just would not run. It was an absolute mess and there was nothing we could do but endure.

I wanted to self-host. So I threw Fedora on an old workstation, installed Docker and then Cloudflare Tunnels.

It wasn't all easy, I had to research, experiment, and learn new things. An attempt to use Podman was killed by a driver bug. Moving the hosting in-house gave my players a reliable custom domain, gave me daily back ups for as long as I wanted them to go, and gave me unlimited storage for additional content. Maps an data take up spacethat webhosts charged a sharp premium for. My workstation machine provided significantly more power to run the server and our problems all went away. 

This cut out my hosting costs and dramatically expanded our capabilities. It does rely on my internet and power holding up, but that's not an issue most of the time. If we miss a night because of a storm, my players will understand.

Rapid Content:

The last piece of the puzzle is content. Maps and other elements are a crucial part of the experience. Theater of the mind has its place, but it's not enough. As I expanded my setup, I was able to reallocate my hosting budget into creators on Patreon, a tool called Moulinette, and AWS storage.

The patreon creators are available through Moulinette which fetches their maps and loads them into Foundry. Foundry takes the maps from Moulinette and stores the on AWS S3. This ensures speedy content delivery to the players and gives us a variety of maps to use. Secondary maps are provided by some map making apps, but those are only used as necessary.

The Whole Picture:

I write deeply linked notes and session plans the day before or day of a session with absolute ease. It takes an hour to write and prepare over 2 hours of actual gameplay content. It's a relaxed workflow that maximizes creativity and allows me to pull in past experiences and events in the session. 

Everything runs smoothly so I'm able to simultaneously access the Foundry platform, upload materials needed from my notes, customize and tweak things, ensuring I spend a minimum of working time to prepare the most actual playing time. These tools and procedures have reduced my stress and maximized my enjoyment of the hobby, as well as created opportunities for a better creative experience for all involved.


Doing Things Differently:

To do it over, I would build a better server for this. Some day, I will. The machine I'm using has perhaps the buggiest motherboard MSI ever built. The thermal management safeties on the motherboard are broken, the NVRam is questionable, it has had GPU issues, either from the motherboard itself or Nvidia being a problem. 

I would love to build an overpowered homelab PC/system and some day, I will. I want to get into docker swarm, kubernetes, and other things of that nature, as well as deeper networking. I haven't yet, but I will.

If I were to do DnD over, I would plan better. My first campaign had no planning, it was off the cuff. We enjoyed ourselves, but as a long-term narrative it had deep flaws that could not be fixed without significnat revision and work.

I've done the best with what I had available and worked to build better. It's a process. I think it's a process that shows my technical ability to research, innovate, and overcome. I never touched Docker before this, but I did now. I never made Dockerfiles before this, but I have now. There is always something new to work on.

This is my longest blog post by-far.

I don't know if the people who need to read it will read it, but hey, I can hope. I can't change a job application that I've already sent in. Every job app is different too. Not many have questions like this and I think this is the first I've seen where I could've done better on my answers.

Maybe the original answers will win some attention or maybe this particular employer will see these answers here.

At the very least, my lesson's been learned: sit on the answer to a question sometimes. It'll take more work to answer it again later. My first answers were written in an hour and these were written in five hours. Minus some time wrangling Astro.

Welcome new readers!

If you're reading this site, you probably came from one of three places:

- Casey Smith's Webring (Hi Tech Writers!)
- An Employer I applied with (Hi potential employer!)
- Social Media (Hi random reader!)

You might be wondering a few questions right now, like "what is a webring?", "what's this site about?", and "what is this guy's favorite linux?"

To be honest, webrings were something I missed entirely, and I did live through the 90s! All of the younger tech workers can now officially call me Old. Before we had SEO, web crawlers, and all the goods-and-bads of modern webdesign, sites lived or died by organic links. You had to know where to look or find a link taking you where to look. Webrings were a part of organically expanding a site's reach. You partnered up with related sites and every site linked to the next in a vast chain.

This site joined a Tech Writing Webring.

Why?

Well, that's actually what this place is all about. I've spent a decade as a freelancer and I admittedly picked a horrible time for a career change. I wanted to take my tech skills and carry them into a job writing about tech. I've built custom web apps, worked in Linux, wrote mobile apps, built things in Unity, meddled with 3D printers, and all the things a tech worker gets into (even Dungeons and Dragons). I even love to write.

I hit a snag when a job wanted a portfolio. How do I prove I can do technical writing? I've done a million internal reports for clients. Written internal guides. Made tools and documented them that have big NDAs involved. I had hit an obstacle.

Well, if you have the skills, do the work first, show it off, and get paid later. I built this site to host a quickly-assembled writing portfolio showcasing technical guides and much of my other work. I had a site that I could just drop right in that portfolio, I learned some new platforms in the process, and I picked up a new thing to update and maintain.

So, welcome to the blog. If you want to know how to build you're own, check out [my writing](/writing), as that will tell you how to build an almost perfect duplicate of this site. If not, enjoy the blog! I'm covering aspects of job hunting, navigating the market, creating tools to help my job search, and there will be some nerdy side-talk about technical things.

Speaking of.... I bet any engineers or really techy people wondered about Linux. If you work in web dev, you almost have to touch a linux box at some point, right? I grew up on Ubuntu (literally, installed it when I was 12). Learned Redhat for some client work. Tinkered in Manjaro and SteamOS for a bit, setup a FreeNas (TrueNas now) server, and settled on Fedora as my current mainstay system. I'd love to migrate more to Fedora Atomic, but it has some rough edges still.

Have a great day new readers and feel free to check out the other blogs in the webring linked in the footer below.

It has been a busy month and perhaps a busier week. I set out a month ago to make a career change and quickly ran into a problem: I didn't have the portfolio pieces or even the social networking to land the job I was aiming for.

Today, I'm setting the first major milestone in getting that job.

I've coded and tweaked [this template](https://github.com/guihubie/free-astro-template) to fit my needs and now it's ready to be stuffed with content. And I might have some bugs to fix still. I'm celebrating that I have so much work ahead of me, but the very first stone on that path has been set and I can start to make progress on that end-goal: a portfolio of writing materials to land a solid job, despite our currently tumultuous job market.

Feel free to check out the other blog posts, the guides, and my portfolio page. Over the coming days and weeks I'll be filling out this site with more writing and guides. It'll be a bit empty on day 1, but not on day 100. We're all starting somewhere.

As I sit here, charting the guide posts one by one, what steps I'll cover and when I'll cover them, I have hit upon a few small snags. Some are in how I want to cover this. Some are in why I'm doing this and what I need to do. Some are in ease of building a site.

I think first off, it's important to remember, this site's purpose is at least in part to demonstrate my writing skills. My natural inclination in my guides is to be colloquial and friendly. I like to explain things as someone would speak. The guides are going to be somewhat inconsistent in their voice. As I go forward, I'm going to have to write some other guides in other tones and voices, which will demonstrate writing range, but not consistency. I'm not happy about that.

Second, I need to do some tweaking on the template. Guihubie's template is extremely good and perfect for my needs - but I think I can improve some of it. As I'm getting to know how Astro works, I want to simplify some things, add variables, and overall try to make the whole setup work better. The actual meat and potatoes/most important part of my guides is not ready.

So I'm writing this and facing down the age old wisdom:

> Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.

I think I need to stall just a bit on the next update to the guide and hammer out some tweaks to the base template first. I also learned more about how Astro works and I can remove some tweaks I already made. 

This is going to slow down my job hunt a bit, I meant to put this site up and very rapidly have a writing portfolio available, but that too, shall have to wait.

No development project is ever completely smooth. At least 90% of this has been smooth sailing, so I was due for a bump.
